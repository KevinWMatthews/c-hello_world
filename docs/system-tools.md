# Compile with CMake and gcc

If your system already has compatible versions of CMake and gcc installed,
the project can be configured and built the project using:

```
$ cd build_c_hello_world
$ cmake ../c_hello_world
$ make
```

Run the resulting executable using:
```
$ ./build_c_hello_world/bin/hello_world
Hello, World!
```
